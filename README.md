# Command-line README Generator

  ## Description
  This command-line application allows users to quickly and easily generate a professional README file for their projects. Users are prompted with a series of questions about their project, including its title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, license, contribution guidelines, tests, and contact information. The application then generates a high-quality, well-formatted README file based on the user's input, saving them time and effort. The application is built using Node.js and the Inquirer.js library.
